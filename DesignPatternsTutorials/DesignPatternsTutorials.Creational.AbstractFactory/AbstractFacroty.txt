The Abstract Factory design pattern provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

The classes and objects participating in this pattern include:
AbstractFactory:
declares an interface for operations that create abstract products
ConcreteFactory:
implements the operations to create concrete product objects
AbstractProduct:
declares an interface for a type of product object
Product:
defines a product object to be created by the corresponding concrete factory
implements the AbstractProduct interface
Client:
uses interfaces declared by AbstractFactory and AbstractProduct classes
