The Factory Method design pattern defines an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. This pattern lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.

The classes and objects participating in this pattern include:

Product:
defines the interface of objects the factory method creates
ConcreteProduct:
implements the Product interface
Creator:
declares the factory method, which returns an object of type Product. Creator may also define a default implementation of the factory method that returns a default ConcreteProduct object.
may call the factory method to create a Product object.
ConcreteCreator:
overrides the factory method to return an instance of a ConcreteProduct.
